NotiBridge Communication Workflow
Android App:
NetworkManager handles Pairing, Authentication, and Unpairing.

If PairingState is UNPAIRED, the mDNS resolver runs continuously to discover the desktop until a persistent connection is established.

Upon successful authentication/pairing, a persistent WebSocket connection is established via WebSocketClient.

Connection Monitoring & Recovery:

Monitors Wi-Fi network changes or persistent connection failures.

If detected, pairingState changes to PAIRED_DISCONNECTED.

After a delay (X seconds), it triggers an mDNS resolver to locate the desktopâ€™s IP.

If resolved, attempts to reconnect and re-establish the persistent WebSocket connection.

Once a persistent connection is established, the mDNS process stops.

All further communication occurs exclusively over the persistent WebSocket connection.

Desktop App:
AuthManager handles Pairing, Authentication, and Unpairing.

If PairingState is UNPAIRED, the mDNS broadcasting process runs continuously to allow the Android app to discover the desktop until a persistent connection is established.

Connection Monitoring & Recovery:

Monitors Wi-Fi network changes or persistent connection failures.

If detected, pairingState changes to PAIRED_DISCONNECTED.

mDNS broadcasting is initiated to allow the Android app to rediscover the desktop.

Once the Android app resolves the IP and re-authenticates, a persistent WebSocket connection is established via WebSocketServer.

Once a persistent connection is established, mDNS broadcasting stops.

All further communication occurs exclusively over the persistent WebSocket connection.
